/**
 * Navigator v1 entry point. Every stacked navigation in the app — messages,
 * contacts, profile, groups, QR codes — goes through this.
 *
 * Key invariants (see `gearui-kit/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, Runtime Contracts):
 *
 * 1. It does **not** replace Kuikly `@Page`. This is a stack inside a single
 *    ComposeContainer.
 * 2. **Kuikly's BACK is topmost-only**: `backPressCallbackList.isNotEmpty()`
 *    decides whether the event is consumed, and `dispatchOnBackEvent()` only
 *    invokes `list.last()`. So Navigator registers exactly **one** BackHandler,
 *    and **only while `canPop = true`** — at the bottom of the stack it must
 *    dispose and hand BACK back to native.
 * 3. A BackHandler registered above Navigator by Dialog / Sheet / ActionSheet
 *    automatically becomes `list.last()` and takes the event first. OverlayHost
 *    registers one while an overlay wants BACK, which is what makes that true.
 * 4. Routes are typed: Navigator is generic over [NavRoute] and an entry carries
 *    its route, so `entry.route` needs no lookup and a `when` over a sealed
 *    route type is exhaustive.
 * 5. Entry keys are generated, never supplied. The exactly-once removal guard is
 *    keyed on them, so a caller-supplied duplicate would silently skip
 *    [onEntryRemoved], saveable-state cleanup and retained-state disposal.
 *
 * Commit 2 added the transition layer. A pop renders two layers at once —
 * current (already the old previous) and a snapshot of the outgoing screen —
 * with an Animatable driving [graphicsLayer] translationX. Edge swipe reuses
 * `Modifier.swipeBack`'s `onProgress` for finger tracking, with complete
 * commit and cancel paths.
 *
 * @param initialRoute route string at the bottom of the stack
 * @param swipeBackEnabled global switch; an individual entry can still opt out
 *                         via [NavOptions.swipeBackEnabled]
 * @param handleBack whether to take over the system back gesture, registered
 *                   through Kuikly's `BackHandler` and **only while
 *                   [NavigatorController.canPop] is true**
 * @param onEntryRemoved called when an entry **finally** leaves the stack: a
 *                       committed pop animation, replace, popTo or resetTo.
 *                       Exactly once — the same entry never fires twice.
 * @param content renders the page for the current entry; during a transition it
 *                is called once for the top and once for the previous layer
 *
 * Note: the edge hot zone is deliberately **not** exposed (review 4). Navigator
 * fixes it at 96dp to clear the leftmost ~24dp where Android's own back gesture
 * takes priority (Phase 0 spike finding). 96dp also works well on iOS.
 */
/**
 * Navigator owning its own stack, rooted at [initialRoute].

 * hold a [rememberNavigatorController] and use the other overload — passing

    //   swiping right from mid-screen returns to the previous page, while a
    //   swipe from the very edge is left to the system gesture (predictive back

        // How it got here — every version below was broken on a real device:
        // - v1, "stable slot with eager remove": beginSwipe pulled the outgoing
        //   entry out of `entries` immediately. Commit did not flicker, but
        //   **cancel put the outgoing entry back**, at which point
        //   `entries.last() == _exiting` (the same key) and slot1's
        //   SaveableStateProvider(key) collided with slot3's — Compose raised
        //   `Key X was used multiple times`, which is fatal. Dragging back and
        //   cancelling crashed the app, and the conversation could not be
        //   reopened afterwards.
        //
        // Final version: **the stack does not change for the duration of a
        // transition**. Neither beginSwipe nor pop touches `entries`; removal
        // happens only when the animation finishes. Visible layers render
        // through a single `forEach + key(entry.key)` loop, so every entry has
        // exactly one stable call site (identity tracked by key) while its role
        // and transform vary with state. That gives:
        // - commit: the survivor goes BELOW -> FRONT at the same loop call site,
        //   so it is not remounted and does not flicker — which is what the v1
        //   stable-slot design was trying to solve in the first place;
        //   cancel: the survivor goes MOVING -> FRONT at the same call site and
        //   is likewise not remounted, while the below layer leaves the loop and
        //   is disposed. **Each key appears exactly once in any frame**, so the

        // cannot be BoxWithConstraints itself (pointerInput receives no events on
