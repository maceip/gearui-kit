# GearUI Kit Architecture

[English](./ARCHITECTURE.md) | [简体中文](./ARCHITECTURE.zh-Hans.md)

GearUI Kit is a Kotlin Multiplatform UI framework built on Kuikly Compose. One
codebase renders to native views on iOS, Android, Web (JS) and HarmonyOS. It is
published as `com.gearui:gearui-kit` (currently `1.0.0-beta8`) and consumed by
`privchat-ui` and other product layers.

## Layer Stack

```text
Application Layer          View / GearApp — one App root per page tree
Component Layer            com.gearui.components.* — 70+ components
Foundation Layer           tokens / primitives / interaction / layout
Runtime Services           Theme · I18n · Overlay · Navigator
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Kuikly Compose             renderer bridge: each Compose node becomes a
                           native view (UIView / android.view / DOM / ArkUI)
```

Each layer only depends on the ones below it. Components never mount their own
Theme/Overlay roots; runtime services never reach into component internals.

## Kuikly Integration

- **Dependency direction.** GearUI compiles against the published Kuikly
  artifacts (`com.tencent.kuikly-open:*`, 2.28.0 across runtime, renderers, KSP
  and iOS Pods). Kuikly source is never patched or vendored; behavior gaps are
  worked around in GearUI or recorded for upstream (see the blur findings in
  [VISUAL_SPEC.md](./VISUAL_SPEC.md)).
- **Rendering model.** Kuikly maps every Compose node to a real platform view.
  Consequences GearUI designs around: `LocalIndication` never reaches the view
  (press feedback is component-owned), heavy off-screen subtrees are destroyed
  and rebuilt on the main thread (pager keep-alive is explicit), and semantics
  are copied to native views automatically by `KuiklySemantisHandler`.
- **Event and field semantics.** `safeAreaInsets`, size-change and density
  fields keep Kuikly's meaning. New capabilities arrive with a documented
  fallback; existing fields are never reinterpreted.

## How Consumers Reference GearUI

| Consumer | Mechanism |
| --- | --- |
| `privchat-app` | `includeBuild("../gearui-kit")` in `settings.gradle.kts` with dependency substitution — source-level composite build for kit, `privchat-ui` and `privchat-sdk-kotlin` |
| External libraries | Maven Central artifact `com.gearui:gearui-kit:<version>` (Android AAR, JS, iOS arm64/simulatorArm64/x64 KLibs) |
| HarmonyOS | Parallel configuration in `settings.ohos.gradle.kts`; separate build and explicit device evidence |

A composite build does not test Maven consumption: releases are verified from
staged artifacts by an independent consumer fixture as well.

## Module And Directory Map

- `gearui-kit/` — the library. Source under
  `src/commonMain/kotlin/com/gearui/`: `components/` (one directory per
  component), `foundation/` (tokens, primitives, interaction, layout, motion,
  material), `theme/`, `i18n/`, `navigation/`, `runtime/`, `App.kt` / `View`.
- `sample/` — integration evidence, not framework internals. One App root,
  real library components only, no ComingSoon placeholders.
- `tokens/` — DTCG 2025.10 source JSON, generated Kotlin and the token
  contract (`tokens/README.md`).
- `scripts/` — token generator, icon generator and `scripts/ci/check_*.sh`
  guards.

## Runtime Contracts

**Single App root.** Pages enter through `GearApp`; business code never mounts
a second Theme/Overlay runtime. A `View` subclass that calls `App(...)` itself
must override `autoWrapApp() = false`.

**Insets.** Host measurements flow through `RuntimeEnvironment` — the only
safe-area source. `safeArea` excludes the keyboard; `keyboard` is separate
geometry from platform host callbacks. Roots stay full-size; safe-area padding
belongs to content (`PageScaffold`), never to the root canvas.

**Overlays.** Created and destroyed through the Overlay runtime, which owns
the scrim, stacking, Back/outside/route/timeout dismissal and exactly-once
removal. Local panel gestures request host dismissal; they do not duplicate
global listeners.

**Application page model (required).** An app built on GearUI has one Kuikly
`@Page` whose `App(...)` holds one `Navigator`; every screen is a typed `NavRoute`
entry (its parameters live in the route, such as `Chat(channelId)`), reached with
`push` and left with `pop`. Not allowed: switching screens with
`when(currentPage)`, a Kuikly page per screen (`RouterModule.openPage`), or a
hand-written swipe back. The reference is privchat-app's `PrivChatRouteHost` and
`PrivChatNavGraph`.

What this buys:

- The same finger-tracking back on all four platforms. Android, the Web and
  HarmonyOS have no system swipe back, and iOS's starts only at the screen edge;
  `Navigator` tracks the finger 1:1 from anywhere, reveals the previous page, and
  arbitrates with horizontal pagers inside the page.
- One runtime. Theme, language, overlays and session state live in one
  composition, so a theme change restyles every page at once, and an overlay
  belongs to the entry that opened it and closes when that page leaves.
- No start-up cost per navigation: no new native controller or Activity, no Kuikly
  page bootstrap, and parameters are typed objects rather than serialized strings.
- One BACK path: Android BACK pops page by page and reaches the host only at the
  bottom of the stack.

Costs and limits: the top entry and the one right beneath it stay composed (the
latter hidden, parked, so a swipe reveals it without building it mid-gesture);
deeper entries leave composition and keep their state through
`SaveableStateHolder` and `RetainedEntry`. The iOS back feel is GearUI's, not the
system `interactivePopGestureRecognizer`. A deep link pushes its route at start-up,
with Home still at the bottom.

**Navigation and swipe back.** `Navigator` is a real stack with per-entry
render. The right-swipe is arbitrated so exactly one owner consumes it:

1. On touch-down the router asks the front page through `PageSwipeBackGate`.
   A paged surface (e.g. `TabPager`) answers "I can still scroll" while its
   current page is not the first, and the router stands down completely.
2. At the page's first page — or when the page has no horizontal paging — the
   router claims the drag in the Initial pass across the full width and moves
   the card 1:1 with the finger.
3. At the bottom of the stack the router lets go entirely, so the pager keeps
   its overscroll tension in both directions.
4. `TabPager` keeps one page on each side composed
   (`beyondViewportPageCount = 1`); with Kuikly's default of 0 a heavy page
   re-entering the viewport costs ~180 ms of main-thread native view creation
   mid-drag.
5. The entry beneath the top stays composed and hidden (parked). It used to be
   built only once the gesture was recognised, which on a device stalled the main
   thread for about 450 ms while the page ignored the finger; parked, the next frame
   comes about 12 ms after recognition. A parked page is hidden from screen readers,
   and the front page takes the hit test, so a tap on blank space never reaches it.

**Desktop scenes.** A wide window does not nest a phone page, and a phone page
does not nest the window. `DesktopShell` is the same `Navigator`. `roleOf` marks
each route for one strategy. List-detail is the default: below 600 the window
shows only the top entry, which on a phone is the detail; from 600 the entry
under it sits beside it; a third pane needs 1200 and an extra entry on the
consecutive run at the top of the stack. A normal page ends that run, so an
older list is not pulled back across it. The supporting pane is two peers. It
has no empty column, and on one partition it yields. The sidebar is the bottom
bar moved across, not a scene column. The Mac and Windows frames are GearUI
layout: a gutter where the host's traffic lights go, and caption buttons that
call the host. `systemTitleBar` leaves that strip out when the operating-system
window already has it. `desktop/windows` opens that window on Windows;
`desktop/macos` is the AppKit host. Kuikly has no Windows renderer, so the
Windows host paints GearUI in the client area. The title bar, resize, and
caption buttons are the system's. There is no second renderer.
Back pops one entry. It does not keep popping while the set of panes stays the
same.

System BACK is bridged by the runtime, not by `androidx.activity` handlers.

## Hard Constraints (PR Gate)

Reject: duplicated global runtime ownership, root-canvas inset clipping,
hidden API breaks, unreviewed baseline changes, silently ignored token values,
new hardcoded design values, missing packaged assets, unverified
compatibility/parity claims, clipped icon+badge bounds in navigation slots,
screen switching or swipe back built around `Navigator`.

Require evidence for: extra allocations, platform branches, motion/blur cost,
new theme extension points, new assets, new platform targets. Ratchet
baselines freeze known debt; passing them is not proof the debt is gone.
